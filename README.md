Sublime Double-Click Bracket Macro
==================================

By default, Sublime Text 2 does not extend selection to brackets when double-clicking a bracket or parenthesis from a set. Sublime provides a shortcut to do so with Cmd+Shift+M, which I find tedious. This file allows you to rapidly highlight contents within brackets with one key and two clicks.
